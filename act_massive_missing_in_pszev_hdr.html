<p style="width:500pt">This table contains clusters that are among the 50 most 
massive in ACT which pass the CHANCES-Evolution sky and redshift cuts but are 
not part of the 50 most massive PSZ2 clusters, which we're using as the basis 
for our sample</p>

<b>Details:</b>
<ul>
    <li><b>(*)</b> are the clusters I would consider including. This is based 
    only on a quick look at the optical image or on prior information (e.g., a 
    Frontier Fields cluster)</li>
    <li><b>no image</b> means it's not in any of the modern optical surveys</li>
    <li><b>Chandra</b> means there are Chandra sources nearby in NED</li>
    <li><b>index</b> refers to the index in the ACT catalogue; it may be useful when referring to clusters in this list</li>
</ul>
