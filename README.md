```cluster-catalogues/chances_clusters_[lowz,evolution]-final.[txt,csv]```

 * The cluster samples are defined in `final-catalogues`.
 * Masses are calculated as we've been doing lately. We take masses from external catalogues with the following prioritization:
   - **Low-z**: CODEX, PSZ2, MCXC
   - **Evolution**: ACT, SPT, PSZ2, CODEX, MCXC
 * As before, PSZ2 and MCXC masses have been re-scaled to a common normalization with ACT as `M_PSZ *= 10^0.13` and `M_MCXC *= 10^0.18`.
